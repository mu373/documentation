# What is Discovery?

## Overview
[Discovery cluster](https://rc.northeastern.edu/) is a **high-performance computing (HPC) resource** for Northeastern University research community, which is physically located in [Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center](https://www.mghpcc.org/about-the-mghpcc/) (MGHPCC) in Holyoke, MA. MGHPCC is a joint venture of multiple universities around Boston&mdash;including Boston University, Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, the UMass system, and Yale&mdash;and provides an intercollegiate high-performance computing for these universities[^mghpcc].

For those who aren't familiar with the HPC cluster, **a cluster is a collection of many separate servers (computers)** interconnected with each other through a network, which **provides capability for conducting intensive and/or parallel computing**. This makes researchers possible to run analysis that can't be run locally on personal devices.

Here's the official overview description of the cluster, provided by the university's Research Computing office[^rc].
> The Discovery cluster provides access to over **50,000 CPU** cores and over **525 GPUs** to all Northeastern faculty and students free of charge. Hardware currently available for research consists of a combination of Intel Xeon (Cascadelake, Skylake, Broadwell, Haswell, Sandybridge, and Ivybridge) and AMD (Zen, Zen2) CPU microarchitectures. Additionally, a selection of NVIDIA Pascal (P100), Volta (V100), Turing (T4), Ampere (A100), and Hopper (H100) GPUs. Discovery is connected to the university network over **10 Gbps Ethernet** (GbE) for high-speed data transfer, and Discovery provides 6 PB of available storage on a high-performance file system. Compute nodes are connected with either 10 GbE or high data rate InfiniBand (200 Gbps or 100 Gbps), supporting all types and scales of computational workloads.
