## Home directory
Home directory is where you primary store your files. Each user gets their own home directory at `/home/your_user_name/`.

For example, if your user name is `john`, it would be `/home/john/`. You can use the shortcut `~/` to access your home directory, instead of writing the absolute path every time.
