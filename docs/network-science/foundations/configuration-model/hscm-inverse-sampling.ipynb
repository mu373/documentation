    "Let $\\rho=\\textrm{Pareto}(\\bar{k}, \\gamma)$ for a HSCM(n,$\\rho$). A random graph in such HSCM can be generated using multiple methods, and this note describes the derivation process from the $k$-generator to the $u$-generator (inverse CDF method). See chapter 9 of the class notes from Network Science 2 for more details."
